## OVERVIEW
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains additional files used for running various
experiments and tests in H-Store. They are not required for the database
to operate and likely are only useful for the researchers working on
the system.

## DIRECTORIES
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

+ CATALOGJSON
Handwritten mappings from MySQL traces for benchmarks to equivalent
H-Store procedures and statements.

+ CONDOR
Job submission scripts to run experiments using the Condor batch processing system.

+ DESIGNHINTS
JSON-based configuration files for running experiments with H-Store's automatic
database partitioning/sharding utility.

+ DESIGNPLANS
Sample database designs produced for various benchmark's using different
design algorithms.

+ MAPPINGS
Probabilistic parameters mappings from Procedure input parameters to their
corresponding Statement input parameters.

+ MARKOVS
Markov models for the benchmark workloads. Used at run time to predict what
transactions will do.
See the following URL for more information:

http://hstore.cs.brown.edu/projects/predictive-modeling

+ STATS
Pre-generated statistics for benchmark workloads. Not really accurate and not used at run-time.

+ WORKLOADS
Sample benchmark workloads. Used extensively for various offline analysis
experiments and testing. The beginning of each file name corresponds to the benchmark that the
trace contains data from.
